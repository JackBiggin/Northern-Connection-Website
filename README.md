# The Northern Connection Website

Having noticed that London seems to be the focus point for the media industry, we couldnâ€™t help but feel that our Northern Universities deserved to hear about what the professional world of media has in store. By pooling our resources and alumnae, we aim to give something positive back to our members by bringing an inspiring networking event to them.

This is The Northern Connection's official website, available at <http://thenorthernconnection.co.uk>. It's pretty simple, but provides a quick and easy way to buy tickets, see the schedule, and learn about the event. Built in a few hours on a random Wednesday afternoon, it's not exactly a bastion of innovation, but it does it's job well enough.

## Versioning - Info for Contributors
As the Northern Connection is a yearly event, the website needs to be updated for each year. This is easy - simply clone last year's branch - for example, the [2017 branch](https://github.com/LUU-Media/Northern-Connection-Website/tree/2017) - to a branch named after this year (for example, 2018). Update everything needed on that branch, then push it to master when you're finished. Since this website is powered by Github Pages, everything will automagically be updated in a few minutes.

Once a year is finished, please don't go and retroactively update a previous year's branch. If you've come up with an amazing idea, simply proactively create the next year's branch and add your improvements there.
